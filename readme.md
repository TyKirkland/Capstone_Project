# Intro:
Hello! My app is a character creation battle arena game where the user has the ability to create any characters, weapons, armor and spells with any stats they wish and have them fight against one another in a text-based fighting game! Play it [here](https://battle-arena.onrender.com/)!

# Installation Step:
Begin by forking and cloning this git repo. Then navigate to the appropriate directory and run this command: "pip3 install -r deps.txt" to install all the necessary dependencies. You then need to create a .env file inside of the battle_arena directory in which you need to provide a DATABASE_URL variable and make it equal to your sql database online. You also need to make a SECRET_KEY variable with whatever value you desire. After that you can simply run python3 manage.py runserver to start the app!

# User Stories:
My user will be anybody interested in solely creating customizable characters that will be stored for you and also those that wish to play around in a simulator type environment to see what fun interactions and fights they can create. My app will allow the user to create characters with different classes and more so the user can create a fantasy library of their dreams!

# Technologies Used:
Python, Django, Bulma

# Wireframes:
You can find my wireframes [here](https://www.figma.com/file/LzZVsJKIXfPKuk0oZURORq/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A14&mode=design&t=uYh9KoIxDf2YMnQI-1)

# Data Models:
You can view my data models [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/313de9e8-8df8-43af-baba-a9e86c322d52/edit?viewport_loc=-725%2C-178%2C1995%2C992%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_69e4c9fe-6f77-42a8-9455-51761fb7c263)

# Stretch Goals:
I want to dive deep into the game part and add animations, different illustrations for the fights and more. I also want to dive deeper into the actual game mechanics to create a balanced game mode where the user can slightly modify their stats instead of unlimited control.
