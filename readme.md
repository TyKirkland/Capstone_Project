# Scope:
I am creating a character creation battle arena game where the user has the ability to create any character with any stats they wish and have them fight against one another. I believe that I will be able to impliment multiple classes that you can assign the character which will change their default stat values as well as their combat style. 

# User Stories:
My user will be anybody interested in solely creating customizable characters that will be stored for you and also those that wish to play around in a simulator type environment to see what fun interactions and fights they can create. My app will allow the user to create characters with different classes and more so the user can create a fantasy library of their dreams!


# Wireframes:
